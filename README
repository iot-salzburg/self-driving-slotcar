The Repository for the slotcar project.
=======================================

• Check out sensor_project for the work done on the movement sensors of the slotcar. Most useful script for future
maybe the slotcar_control.py script with which one can interact with the 6 Car Power Base to control the slotcar.

• Check out gym-slotcar for a slotcar client for a RL algorithm which is provided by OpenAI. Depends also on computer_
vision dir.

• Check computer_vision for everything related to analyzing where the car is on the track and following it through
computer vision.
